Building the Apache Edgent SDK from a Source Distribution

Apache Edgent is supported on several Java target platforms.
For more information see JAVA_SUPPORT.md in the source tree
or in the ASF git repository https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-edgent.git
or in the repository mirror at github https://github.com/apache/incubator-edgent.

Pre-requisites:
- Java 8 is required to build an Edgent binary distribution
- Network connectivity a maven repository such as Maven Central
- A maven-integrated IDE will be required if you want to do
  development using an IDE.

The source release includes a Maven wrapper. The wrapper removes
the need for the user to manually install maven on their system.


Building the Edgent SDK Java8 jars and installing them in the local maven repository

$ ./mvnw clean install # add -DskipTests to save time and omit running the tests
 

Building the SDK jars for Java7 and Android too (if needed)

Create a toolchains-local.xml file by cloning the toolchains-travis.xml file
and setting the appropriate j8-jdk-home and j7-jdk-home locations on your system
e.g., on OSX system:
  j8 jdkHome:  /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_112.jdk/Contents/Home
  j7 jdkHome:  /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_80.jdk/Contents/Home

$ ./mvnw -t toolchains-local.xml clean install -Pplatform-java7,platform-android  # add -DskipTests to save time and omit running the tests

If you put the toolchain information in `~/.m2/toolchain.xml` you 
can omit the `-t toolchains-local.xml` from the command.


At the conclusion of the build, the Edgent SDK jars will have been 
installed in the local maven repository and may then be used for 
Edgent Application development.


See samples/README.md in the Edgent Samples source bundle or github repository
for general information on Edgent Application development and deployment, 
and for building and running the samples.

Apache Edgent is released under the Apache License Version 2.0.

Apache Edgent is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF),
sponsored by the Incubator PMC. Incubation is required of all newly accepted
projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications,
and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other
successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection
of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project
has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
